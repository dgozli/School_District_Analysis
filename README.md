# School District Analysis

## Overview

We had initially made a DataFrame that combined student data and school data. We conducted analyses on the average scores (math and reading) as well as the average number of students passing, based on a number of independent variables: school, grade, school budget (spending per student), school size, and school type (charter vs. district). We then repeated and modified our analyses after we were asked to remove the scores of the 9th-grade students at Thomas High School, due to possible cheating. The modified analyses appear in the Jupyter Notebook file beginning at cell 54.
